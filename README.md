## 🐼 What is Pandas?

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an **open-source Python library** providing:

* 🧾 **Series**: One-dimensional labeled data.
* 📊 **DataFrame**: Two-dimensional labeled data (like Excel/SQL tables).
* 📅 **Time-Series Support**: Powerful tools for handling dates and times.
* 🛠 **Data Cleaning, Merging, and Aggregation**.
* 📈 **Statistical Operations and Visualization**.

Pandas is widely used in **data science, finance, machine learning, and scientific computing**.
